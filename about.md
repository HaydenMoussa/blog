Hi, I am Hayden Moussa. I am a current Hendrix College student starting my 3rd year. I am a computer science and mathmatics major. In my free time I like to play Old School Rune Scape and hike. Last summer I hike the Appalichan trail, or part of it. I got 850 miles under my belt before running out of money. It was the most unique experiances I've ever had. Here is a like to Old School Rune Scape if you ever want to play.
